```bash
# Run simultaneously (different files):
Task: "Define core types in src/types/core.ts"
Task: "Define LINE message types in src/server/types/line.ts"
Task: "Define API request/response types in src/server/types/api.ts"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Contract Tests

```bash
# Run simultaneously (independent test files):
Task: "Contract test POST /api/liff/signup in tests/contract/liff-signup.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/liff/booking in tests/contract/liff-booking.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/line/webhook in tests/contract/line-webhook.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/geocode in tests/contract/geocode.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/admin/bookings/:id/confirm in tests/contract/admin-confirm.test.ts"
```

### Phase 3.4 - Server Utilities

```bash
# Run simultaneously (different utility files):
Task: "LIFF token validation utility in src/server/lib/liffAuth.ts"
Task: "Google Sheets service in src/server/repo/sheets.ts"
Task: "Patient repository methods in src/server/repo/users.ts"
Task: "Booking repository methods in src/server/repo/bookings.ts"
```

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts (api-spec.yaml)**:
   - Each endpoint ‚Üí contract test task [P] (T008-T012)
   - Each endpoint ‚Üí implementation task (T027-T031)
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity ‚Üí type definition [P] (T005-T007)
   - Repository methods for data persistence (T020-T022)
3. **From LINE Integration**:

   - Intent routing and flow handlers (T023-T026)
   - Message templates and webhook processing (T026, T029)

4. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - User flow integration tests [P] (T017-T018)
   - LIFF authentication validation (T013, T019)

## Current Codebase Integration

This task list builds upon the existing LabMove codebase:

- **Extends** current Next.js structure in `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/server/`
- **Enhances** existing LIFF forms, LINE webhook handler, and agent routing
- **Adds** TanStack Query for server state management
- **Integrates** with current Google Sheets and Redis infrastructure
- **Maintains** existing Zustand stores for UI state

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before task execution_

- [ ] All API contracts have corresponding tests (T008-T012 - admin confirm pending)
- [x] All entities have type definitions (T005-T007)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.3 ‚Üí 3.4)
- [x] Parallel tasks are independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] TDD cycle enforced (tests must fail first)
- [x] Integration with existing codebase maintained
- [x] Performance targets considered (LIFF < 1.5s, webhook < 2s)

## Notes

- Tests in Phase 3.3 MUST fail before proceeding to implementation
- [P] tasks can run simultaneously on different files
- Each task should result in a meaningful git commit
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Maintain backwards compatibility with current features
