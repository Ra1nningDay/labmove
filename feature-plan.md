### Core Features

# Login / Logout

Users and staff can securely log into the platform with proper session management, and log out at any time. This ensures protected access to personal data, booking details, and administrative tools.

# Excel Import to Dataset

Administrators can upload Excel files directly into the system, which are parsed and transformed into structured datasets. This reduces manual data entry, speeds up onboarding of new records, and ensures consistency across the platform.

# Notification System

Unverified Cards: The system automatically flags and notifies relevant parties when user or booking cards remain unverified, prompting timely follow-up.
Staff Alerts: Notifications are sent to staff members when their intervention is required (e.g., approval, confirmation, or changes in booking status).
Cancellation Notices: When a card or booking is canceled, both staff and affected users receive immediate alerts to minimize confusion and ensure clarity in the process.
